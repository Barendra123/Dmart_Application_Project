        <strong>Better Schools, Brighter Futures!</strong><br><br>

At DMart, we believe in corporate social responsibility and have always been committed to contributing to the communities in which we operate. While being focused on sustained economic performance, we are also acutely aware of the necessity and importance of social stewardship. Towards this end, we seek to enrich the lives of the future generation – the children of our country – through our efforts to create better environments and infrastructure in public schools in select wards of Mumbai city. <br><br>

We have a school excellence program through which we aim to develop infrastructure , improve educational facilities and work towards sustainable progress in public schools in selected wards of Mumbai . We work with these schools and seek to implement better teaching facilities (such as libraries & science labs) and develop infrastructure (such as toilets and playgrounds) by working with partner organisations. We hope to improve the quality of education and provide children with better education and development opportunities. <br><br>

Our constant focus on educating the citizens of tomorrow has seen strong progress in the current year. In FY 2018-19, we have aided more than 95,000 students and helped them in their goal of educating themselves for a better tomorrow. Our intent is to continue working towards foundational learning among the students leading to basic grade specific student learning outcomes.
